It's very expensive seafood, but I guess that's expected in Boston and the prices are very visible.

We visited on a Saturday around 4:30 and waited 20 minutes to be seated (even with clearly empty tables visible on both sides of the restaurant). Once seated we had no service for ~10 minutes. Our drinks took another 10 minutes to arrive.  We asked the food runner for ketchup, and he never came back so I grabbed one from a nearby empty table.  We probably spoke to our server 3 times total, and even had to flag her down to pay the check when she walked past our table 3 separate times and never grabbed the cards to pay the bill.

I was really dissatisfied with the poor service.", user: user2)

I’m so glad! The atmosphere is cozy but open. Energetic, but not too loud. We had a server who had the same balance - he was super attentive and offered expert guidance, but he was also very chill and easy going. We had several things from the raw menu (basically everything our server suggested) and a few other small plates. Everything was delicious, fresh, and thoughtfully prepared. We got lucky and were able to sneak in without a reservation because we went insanely early (like 5:30 pm). I wouldn’t try to go again without a reservation, it is definitely a super popular (and amazing!) place.", user: user1)

Fun atmosphere, loud but not overly so. Food was fairly solid throughout. Oysters were great but messed up the order a bit. Lobster roll was tasty but way over priced.

The views of Boston Harbor and the airplanes taking off and landing at Logan are a lovely bonus.  While they take their wines extremely seriously (the wine list has many bottles priced in the hundreds and even thousands of dollars), you can get a very enjoyable three-glass flight to go with your meal for about $25.  Service is on par with the best fine dining available in Boston.  Plating is amazingly playful, with (spoiler alert) dry ice coming with the scallops and the mushroom dish served on a beautiful wooden platter.  All told, you can get out of there for $80 per person with wine, so quite reasonable for what you're getting.  Highly recommended!", user: user2)

The staff was very friendly, and we had no trouble getting a table for just drinks during dinner hours. The beer list is very limited, but the mixed drinks make up for it. Prices weren't out of line given the location (~$15/cocktail), and I would say the drinks were worth it. The patio has fire space heaters, and we would come back again in the future.", user: user5)
